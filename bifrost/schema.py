# HACK: Remove NoUnusedFragments validator
# Due to the way previews work on the frontend, we need to pass all
# fragments into the query even if they're not used.
# This would usually cause a validation error. There doesn't appear
# to be a nice way to disable this validator so we monkey-patch it instead.


# We need to update specified_rules in-place so the change appears
# everywhere it's been imported
